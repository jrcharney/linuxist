# Linuxist

Linuxist is the all-in-one script for people who want to get started using Linux.  Along the way, I've also included some fun stuff.  Those "hacker secrets" everybody seems to show off but never demonstrate.

This project will include things for setting up several software. The two important ones I highly recommend are Vim and Tmux.

Other things like modern programming stuff like Node.js and PostgreSQL will also be included. I do NOT recommend using a LAMP stack becaus of the amount of resources Apache consumes compared to the lithe setup that a MERN stack has to offer.

If you are using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, I highly recommend you download this project after you've downloaded my windows project designed for it called [Windowsist](https://github.com/jrcharney/windowsist).

## Features

Along the way, I will also include somethings I highly recommend you install [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a preset `~/.vimrc` file to get you up and running, and where to find all those fonts and toys that make everything work.  I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for Vim plugins and taking a look at [Nerd Fonts](http://nerdfonts.com/).  Because we are using Vim, we ill be using plugins like [Vim Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), along with the [themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) and compatible fonts that allow you to have access to all those extra glyphs.

Furthermore, I also recommend using [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) which has plugins that work with Vim (such as [tmuxline](https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)) and extend the functionality (which will use [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)).

## FAQ

### Is it ready yet?
Consider this in alpha at the moment on the verge of becoming beta.  I just need to upload some sanitized dotfiles and fix a few more icons.

### Why did you upload a script that can't run?
I think it is more important that I organize my thoughts first before I execute them.  Linux requires so much

### I'm using Ubuntu, things don't look right. What should I do?
File an issue.  My next step is to eventually fire up Oracle VM Virtual box and try it with other Debian Distros (e.g. Linux Mint)

### Can this thing run on Raspberry Pi?
I don't know. I would hope that it does. Knowing how slow some of the software behaves, I would hold off on making a Raspberry Pi that does everything in this script.

### I'm not using an Debian based Linux distro. What about us?
I can't appease everybody.  I'd like to think that I would eventually port this to Fedora to flatter some folks at Red Hat or Amazon Web Service.  Maybe you could help out by forking this project later when I've [*"BECOME FAMOUS"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryasjfFAPLE).

As for the ArchLinux and Gentoo Linux folks, you are defintely on your own right now.

### What license is this all under?
MIT License.  This is actually one of the first curl-pushed repos I've made that I forgot to include some details in the JSON data.  No matter, I got another project in the works that could fix that.

### How are you funding this project Jason?  Don't you have to eat and pay bills?
That's a seriously kind question!  I'm hoping to link up with a Patreon account assuming I make sense of the tax stuff that goes with it.


In the meantime, welcome to that part of Linux everyone wanted but were too afraid to do it themselves.  **WELCOME TO THE LINUXIST!**
