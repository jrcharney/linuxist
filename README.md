# Linuxist

Linuxist is the all-in-one script for people who want to get started using Linux.  Along the way, I've also included some fun stuff.  Those "hacker secrets" everybody seems to show off but never demonstrate.

This project will include things for setting up several software. The two important ones I highly recommend are Vim and Tmux.

Other things like modern programming stuff like Node.js and PostgreSQL will also be included. I do NOT recommend using a LAMP stack becaus of the amount of resources Apache consumes compared to the lithe setup that a MERN stack has to offer.

If you are using Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, I highly recommend you download this project after you've downloaded my windows project designed for it called [Windowsist](https://github.com/jrcharney/windowsist).

## Features

Along the way, I will also include somethings I highly recommend you install [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), a preset `~/.vimrc` file to get you up and running, and where to find all those fonts and toys that make everything work.  I recommend using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for Vim plugins and taking a look at [Nerd Fonts](http://nerdfonts.com/).  Because we are using Vim, we ill be using plugins like [Vim Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), along with the [themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) and compatible fonts that allow you to have access to all those extra glyphs.

Furthermore, I also recommend using [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) which has plugins that work with Vim (such as [tmuxline](https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)) and extend the functionality (which will use [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)).
